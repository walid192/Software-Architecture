# SOLID Principles Workshop

Welcome to the SOLID Principles Workshop! This workshop is designed to help you understand and apply the SOLID principles of object-oriented design in your software development projects. The SOLID principles provide a set of guidelines to create maintainable, scalable, and flexible software.

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, we will cover the following SOLID principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the workshop, please make sure you have the following:

- [ ] A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse)
- [ ] Git installed on your machine
- [ ] Basic understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts

## Workshop Setup

1. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solid-workshop.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd solid-workshop
   ```



## Workshop Structure

The workshop is divided into five modules, each covering one of the SOLID principles. Each module contains the following:

- **README.md:** A detailed explanation of the SOLID principle, its importance, and how to apply it in your code.
- **Starter Code:** A set of starter code files that you will use to complete the exercises.
- **Exercises:** A series of exercises to help you practice applying the SOLID principle in your code.
